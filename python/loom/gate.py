"""gate.py — the synchronous, fail-closed produces gate (vault re-derivation).

Ported from wicked-garden scripts/qe/vault_gate.py, with the subprocess
execution injected (the ``run`` parameter, same RunResult shape as compose.py)
so callers and tests control side effects and no real vault is ever spawned in
a unit test.

Invariants (spec §5):
  I1 — synchronous + in-line: exactly one blocking vault call per invocation;
       no events are consulted. An event NEVER satisfies a gate.
  I2 — fail-closed: vault unresolvable OR unrunnable OR non-JSON ->
       gate "unavailable" / overall "ERROR", satisfied False. Never a pass.
  I3 — fail-soft on the verifier spec only: a present ``verifier_spec`` is
       forwarded to the vault; its ABSENCE never blocks and never vacates the
       gate — the vault falls back to generic detection.

Hard gates additionally require an independent attestation: pass
``with_attestations=True`` -> ``--with-attestations`` forwarded to the vault.

The return is a status dict (R4 — surface as data, never raise):
  {satisfied, re_derived, gate, overall, exit_code, argv, detail, error}
