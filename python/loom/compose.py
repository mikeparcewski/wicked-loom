"""compose.py — version-check + install orchestration over the peer set.

check_peer:  resolve -> probe -> parse version -> compare MAJOR.MINOR to the pin.
install_peer: run the peer's headless install command.
check_all:   one check_peer row per known peer.

Subprocess execution is injected (the ``run`` parameter) so callers (and tests)
control side effects. Nothing here raises — failures are returned as status
rows ("ok" | "drift" | "present" | "missing" | "error" | "installed"
| "install-failed").

Status semantics (no cry-wolf — see R4 "never raise, surface as data"):
  ok       — resolved, probe ran, version parsed, version >= pin.
  drift    — resolved, probe ran, version parsed, version <  pin.
  present  — resolved AND the probe binary RAN (we got a RunResult, not an
             exception), but its version could not be determined: a non-zero
             exit (older CLIs print help/usage when given ``--version``) or
             unparseable output. The peer is healthy/responding; we just can't
             read its version. This is WARN-level, NOT an error — reporting a
             responding peer as "error" was a false alarm (cry-wolf). The
             ``ok`` flag on the row is True so health probes don't fail hard.
  missing  — unresolvable: no binary on PATH / npx / env override (kill-switch).
  error    — reserved for genuine faults: unknown peer, or the probe attempt
             RAISED (binary vanished, OS error). A responding-but-unparseable
             peer is NEVER "error".
