"""resolve.py — the runtime resolution ladder for a peer's runnable command.

Ladder (highest priority first):
  1. WICKED_<PEER>_BIN env var — explicit override. Empty string is a
     deliberate kill-switch (returns None, resolution short-circuits cleanly).
  2. PATH — shutil.which(<package>).
  3. npx fallback — ["npx", "<package>"].

``<package>`` is the peer's npm_package for the runnable command, but the
version-probe binary can differ (see manifest.Peer.version_package). The env
override / kill-switch is keyed on the peer regardless of which binary we are
resolving — an explicit override (or kill-switch) governs the whole peer.

Returns a command as a list[str] (argv-ready) or None when unresolvable /
killed / unknown peer. Pure + deterministic: no process is spawned here.
