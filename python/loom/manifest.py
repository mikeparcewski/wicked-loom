"""manifest.py — the wicked-* peer set: what each peer is and how to reach it.

Source of truth ported from wicked-garden docs/required-peers.md + plugin.json.
Version pins are the MAJOR.MINOR floor (the `^x.y` in plugin.json), compared by
compose.py. Install commands are headless (npm/npx) — the `/plugin install`
path is CC-UX sugar, not the only route.

Capability honesty (the never-fake contract)
---------------------------------------------
Each peer carries a declared capability ``status`` — ``wired`` | ``planned`` |
``experimental`` — distinct from runtime *reachability* (resolve + version-pin,
which compose.py reports as ok/drift/present/missing/error). ``status`` answers
a different question: "is this peer's capability declared ready for the runtime
to depend on?" The contract, ported from the factory's stack-registry, is
absolute: **the runtime NEVER pretends a non-``wired`` peer satisfies a gate.**
When a flow requires a peer that is ``planned``/``experimental`` (or
unresolvable), the runner emits a precise ``capability-gap`` naming exactly
which peer must be installed/wired — it never silently proceeds and never fakes
a pass (see flow.py). Capability is *data*, never invented.
